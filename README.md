My name is Sachith(@sachith-0124)! 

I am a Data Science Graduate Student at Texas A&M University, with an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering.
I have a combined work experience of 2+ years in Web Developement and Data Science.

I am interested in building cool new stuff with data and clever algorithms!

I am currently living in College Station, TX; and am looking for any internship starting Spring '23 or a full time offer starting May '23.

Feel free to reach me out!
